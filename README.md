# LLM
This project is a Document-based Question Answering (Q&amp;A) application powered by LangChain, local LLMs via Ollama, and a Streamlit frontend. It allows users to upload files (PDFs, images, etc.), extracts text using OCR and parsing tools, and answers questions based on the document content.
